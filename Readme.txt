Note:
The corrections are as follows.

-> For district boundaries: Attribute corrections and Topology Corrections (Ring Self Intersection). 
   About 8-10 features indicated invalid geometry issues. This was corrected using QGIS.
   More details on this pls refer to https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/handling_invalid_geometries.html

   Similar to method as District Boundaries correction
   Further, some polygons showed issues with vertices inside the polygon boundary.
   Such vertices were manually removed and the updated files are uploaded here.
